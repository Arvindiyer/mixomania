There’s something about storms that speaks to the soul—not just the external weather, but the inner turmoil we all face. This is a poem about transience: of love, memory, even identity. 

**The sky hangs low, the air stands still,**  
**Clouds lean upon the window sill.**  
**Thunder groans—an ancient vow,**  
**Lightning carves the darkness now.**  

**The rain returns, a lover’s trace,**  
**But never stays, won’t leave a face.**  
**I walk the streets where echoes burn,**  
**Each step erased—no way to turn.**  

**The storm once whispered me by name,**  
**Now hums it soft, then hides its flame.**  
**One final cry, one final sigh—**  
**When all is still, when all is done…**  
**Did the storm leave, or had I gone?**


If you’ve ever stood at the edge of a storm—literal or emotional—you might know the feeling: that strange in-between where everything is still, but nothing is quite the same.  

I hope this poem resonates with you. 🌈✨
