Lonely, I drift in the sky of dreams,  
Alone, I carry the breeze of hope.  
On barren ground, I walk and sigh,  
Yet on wings of trust, I rise and fly.  

The blackness wraps me in silent hue,  
These thoughts, they cling like morning dew.  
I lay out fragments, torn and worn,  
Longing for peace where light is born.  

Years of silence now my closest friends,  
Tears that fall, and grief that never ends.  
In this hollow life, I roam and yearn,  
For a tender touch, for the tide to turn.  

A poem by Arvind Iyer.
