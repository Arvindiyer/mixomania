A random thought article written in 2014 when I was 20. I was going through a lot of changes and emotions at that time, and I wanted to express them in writing. This article is a reflection of my thoughts and feelings during that period written in my abdoned blogspot [blog](https://arvindkiyer.blogspot.com/2014/12/turmoil-20.html)


## Turmoil@20

As time files thick and fast so does the days past.Soon enough each birth days make one loose your innocence from scale of 10 to a decline factor or saturation.Speaking about ages its like a historical topic as even the pundits and research analyst could not specify it and justify it.The most crucial one is @20.I bit sound stereotype but everyone face it and handle differently.This age brings so much bundle of emotions not the emoticons of Facebook or Whatsaap rather to say hormonal locha (troubles) .Its absolutely true .Here the common sense becomes nonsense.A teenager tag becomes a senior tag or rather still a kid with teenager tag .Oh god its so confusing isn't it. No this is just the beginning of what i am saying. Adjusting to feelings of affection and longing to have some one in accompany make u feel frustrated or just a feeling inching inside you to shout out but you cant. I am writing this or poking out my emotions is a colossal thing or I am lost in my taught.This i guess happens to all or it happens to me only is what I think .Oh god why?? The Friends and them leaving or what am I without them or am I possessive to them ???All are answered ones which are to be faced soon or am I thinking too in future .If share with others i am mad,Am i ?? I am still confused as others are or may be i am speculating others thoughts too.All i say i am going through a face which is turmoil or it is the way party happens in mind .But @20 is turmoil for me for not knowing whats happening to me !!!

Thank you for reading! ðŸ˜Š
