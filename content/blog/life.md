<!-- #### Life is Deception!! -->

Life is full of flip and flops  
As jumping and falling rides,  
Spreading rainbow around  
Among all the up and downs.  

Life is full of sprout and joy  
As melody ringing around  
Creating hues of love in air  
As if saying everything is in there.  

Life is all but ebbs and flow  
As fast as metro running there  
Saying be strong as falling leaves  
Deception is what you see roaming around.  

Life is glee and disappointment  
Glued as thoughts chucking around  
Making us smile and sad day in and out  
A magician up there scripting the play around.  

Life is You and I  
Like ego attached to pride  
Yet so different and unpredictable  
But life goes on and on  
But faith and belief remain intact.  

A poem by Arvind Iyer.
