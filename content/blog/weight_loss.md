## My Weight Loss Journey: <span style="color:#FF5733">Discipline Over Motivation 💪</span>

I finished my PhD in June 2024 and came home without any firm plans—just a much‑needed break from science to spend time with family. I took trips, ate a lot, and enjoyed the slower pace <span style="color:#2E86C1">🌴🍛</span>.

A routine health check before a family event in December 2024 turned into a reality check: my doctor advised me to <span style="color:#C70039; font-weight:bold;">lose weight</span> for the sake of my liver and long‑term health <span style="color:#FFC300">🩺⚠️</span>. That straightforward warning made the issue real.

So I decided to treat this as a <span style="color:#28B463; font-weight:bold;">priority</span> rather than a vague intention. I set a clear goal and created a 2025 vision board (with a bit of help from AI) to keep the focus visible and actionable <span style="color:#FF5733">🎯🖼️</span>.

Below is the vision board and the plan I used to turn that wake‑up call into sustainable progress.

<span style="color:#C70039; font-weight:bold;">Weight loss</span>, for me, was never about chasing an aesthetic goal or following a trendy routine. It became a deliberate decision to <span style="color:#FF5733; font-weight:bold;">rebuild discipline</span>, <span style="color:#28B463; font-weight:bold;">regain physical confidence</span>, and <span style="color:#2E86C1; font-weight:bold;">stabilize my mental health</span> after a long and mentally demanding academic phase.  

This post is a reflection on that journey, what worked, what failed, and the <span style="color:#FFC300; font-style:italic;">lessons I learned along the way</span>.

## Where I Started 🏁

Around the same time last year, my weight hovered around **<span style="color:#C70039">98–100 kg</span>**. My days were mostly sedentary, shaped by research deadlines (working on a paper, eager to share that out soon), long screen hours (watching movies), and an irregular routine. Exercise was sporadic (let say not there), sleep inconsistent, and food choices were driven by convenience rather than intent. I didn’t feel acutely ill, but I was persistently <span style="color:#FF5733; font-weight:bold;">fatigued</span>, mentally <span style="color:#2E86C1; font-weight:bold;">foggy</span>, and physically <span style="color:#28B463; font-weight:bold;">unconfident</span>.

The turning point wasn’t dramatic; it was a quiet realization that this trajectory was <span style="color:#FFC300; font-style:italic;">unsustainable</span>. If I wanted longevity in life, clarity of thought, and resilience under pressure, my <span style="color:#C70039; font-weight:bold;">physical health</span> had to become non‑negotiable.  

That simple shift in perspective made small, consistent actions suddenly worth prioritizing over occasional bouts of motivation 🌱.

## The First Decision: <span style="color:#FF5733">Consistency Over Intensity</span> 🏃‍♂️

I started with one guiding principle: **<span style="color:#28B463; font-weight:bold;">show up every day, even if imperfectly</span>**.

There was no aggressive calorie cutting or extreme workout plan. Instead, I focused on small, sustainable habits:

* 🚶‍♂️ Regular walking and light jogging  
* 🏋️ Basic gym sessions focused on form, not load  
* ⏰ Fixed workout times to remove daily decision fatigue  

Initially, progress was slow—the scale barely moved. But something else shifted first: my **relationship with routine**. Exercise became an appointment, not a negotiation.  

To make this journey sustainable, I enrolled with an amazing fitness mentor 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ [Pragnesh](https://linktr.ee/pragneshrunner) 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️. He is still helping me 🙂  Do check him out 💡.

## Learning to Swim at 30: <span style="color:#FF5733">Facing Fear Directly</span> 🏊‍♂️

Deciding to take swimming lessons at 30 was one of the clearest acts of courage I’ve made for my health and also a way to step out of my comfort zone and **conquer my fears** 💪.

Over time, the pool taught me three practical skills that carried over into the rest of my routine:

* 🌬️ <span style="color:#2E86C1; font-weight:bold;">Breath control</span> — learning to exhale fully in the water reduced panic and improved recovery between intervals  
* 🧘 <span style="color:#28B463; font-weight:bold;">Composure</span> — short, uncomfortable sets forced me to practice staying calm under stress  
* 📈 <span style="color:#FFC300; font-weight:bold;">Gradual progress</span> — measurable, repeatable improvements (laps, time, distance) made discipline feel rewarding  

I’m especially glad I had a **partner in crime** for this venture: the newest member of my family, aka my sister-in-law, aka my sister 😄❤️

## Building a Sustainable Weekly Structure 🗓️

Over time, my routine stabilized into something sustainable:

* 🏊 Swimming  
* 🏃 Running or run‑walk sessions  
* 💪 Core workouts  
* 🛌 One complete rest day  
* 🧘 10–15 minutes of daily meditation  

P.S. After returning to research, swimming is no longer part of my routine (miss it), but meditation and staying active have become **natural habits**, exactly what I envisioned at the start of 2025 🌱.

## Diet: <span style="color:#FF5733">Minimalism, Not Restriction</span> 🍽️

I did not follow a named diet. Instead, I made **incremental, realistic changes**:

* 🚫 Reduced mindless snacking  
* 🍗 Prioritized protein where possible  
* 🍛 Maintained an Indian food base rather than forcing crazy meal plans  

The key shift was **awareness, not deprivation**. Once exercise became consistent, appetite regulation followed naturally. **Eating Nuts and frutis play a huge role !!**

---

## Progress So Far 📊

As of now, I weigh approximately **<span style="color:#C70039">86 kg</span>**, down roughly **10–12 kg** from my peak. More importantly:

* ⚡ Energy levels are stable  
* 😴 Sleep quality has improved  
* 🩹 Injuries are minimal  
* 🧠 Mental clarity during work has improved noticeably  

Weight loss became a **side effect** of a healthier system, not the sole objective.

## What Actually Mattered ✅

Looking back, these were the non‑negotiables:

1. <span style="color:#28B463; font-weight:bold;">Routine beats motivation</span>—every single time  
2. <span style="color:#FF5733; font-weight:bold;">Fear‑based goals</span> (like swimming) produce outsized growth  
3. <span style="color:#2E86C1; font-weight:bold;">Slow progress compounds quietly</span>  
4. <span style="color:#FFC300; font-weight:bold;">Fitness improves research productivity more than caffeine ever did</span>

## Where This Is Going 🔮

This journey is ongoing. With an upcoming transition into a new research environment, my goal is not to chase a number on the scale, but to enter the next phase **physically capable, mentally steady, and disciplined by default** 💪🧘‍♂️.

If you are starting late, restarting, or struggling to be consistent—there is **nothing wrong with slow progress**. The only real failure is waiting for the “perfect” moment to begin ⏳.

*This post is part of my ongoing effort to document **systems, not outcomes**. If this resonates with you, feel free to reach out or follow along ✨.*

As you might have noticed from my vision board, another activity I wanted to focus on was **writing blogs**. Admittedly, I haven’t been very consistent, and not much had been achieved there… until now. Let’s say this blog is my **kickstart** 🚀—a step toward making writing a regular part of my journey.
