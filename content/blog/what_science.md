**Somethings that take my sleep away 🌙**

Here's the thing about having a <span style="color:#9B59B6; font-weight:bold;">PhD</span> (sometimes I question that, too): the "<span style="color:#3498DB; font-weight:bold;">Ph</span>" stands for <span style="color:#3498DB; font-weight:bold;">philosophy</span>, and sometimes those neurons decide to go rogue at 1 AM.
So I started wondering: Is science actually <span style="color:#27AE60; font-weight:bold;">rational</span>, or is it just the <span style="color:#E74C3C; font-weight:bold;">perspective</span> we've all agreed on for now, based on reasoning and logic?

"<span style="color:#F39C12; font-style:italic;">Rational means quality of being in spirit with reason or logic.</span>"

Think about it: <span style="color:#2E86C1; font-weight:bold;">Newton's law</span> was the foundation of science for over two hundred years. Then <span style="color:#8E44AD; font-weight:bold;">Einstein</span> came along with a new theory and basically said, "<span style="color:#E74C3C;">Actually, no.</span>" What's in today's textbook might just be a <span style="color:#95A5A6; font-style:italic;">historical note tomorrow</span>. By the way, if you're curious about the difference between a law and a theory, check out this video: [1](https://youtu.be/GyN2RhbhiEU?si=ored8cQqXu-O1hcN), [2](https://youtu.be/EVJdwD7coQ4?si=DdIDZSQ-QNIGzEzF).

If science is always changing, how is it different from good belief systems like veganism or minimalism? Both collect evidence, have communities that discuss and improve ideas, and both can change when new information comes in.

## The Selfish Science Hypothesis 🤔

This is where my thoughts start to get a little <span style="color:#E74C3C; font-style:italic;">strange</span>, so stick with me:
Is science <span style="color:#C0392B; font-weight:bold;">objectively selfish</span>?
Science is built to serve as the framework within which it works. It focuses on solving the problems <span style="color:#F39C12;">it considers important</span> and rewards discoveries that fit <span style="color:#F39C12;">its current way of thinking</span>. As <span style="color:#8E44AD; font-weight:bold;">Thomas Kuhn</span> wrote:

"<span style="color:#2C3E50;">Normal science, the activity in which most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like.</span>"
— <span style="color:#9B59B6;">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</span>

The <span style="color:#3498DB; font-weight:bold;">community</span> decides what's interesting, <span style="color:#27AE60; font-weight:bold;">funding bodies</span> decide what gets funded, and <span style="color:#E67E22; font-weight:bold;">journals</span> decide what gets published. In a way, science serves itself. Isn't that a kind of <span style="color:#C0392B; font-weight:bold;">selfishness</span>? Still, many people see this self-organization and change as a way for science to <span style="color:#27AE60; font-weight:bold;">correct itself</span> and move forward together. Instead of selfishness, it might be how science stays <span style="color:#3498DB;">strong</span> and <span style="color:#9B59B6;">flexible</span>, always getting better through teamwork and discussion.
Or maybe I'm just a <span style="color:#95A5A6; font-style:italic;">tired postdoc</span> with too many big questions on my mind ☕

## But Wait, There's a Constraint ⚖️

This is where I start to bring myself back to reality:
<span style="color:#27AE60; font-weight:bold;">Perspective-laden isn't the same as arbitrary.</span>
The <span style="color:#3498DB;">semiconductor</span> in my laptop works. <span style="color:#27AE60;">Vaccines</span> stop diseases. <span style="color:#F39C12;">Predictions</span> either come true or they don't. The universe has a way of keeping our beliefs in check.
Minimalism's main idea, that "<span style="color:#95A5A6; font-style:italic;">simplicity is better</span>" or "<span style="color:#95A5A6; font-style:italic;">less is more</span>," can't really be tested or proven wrong in a scientific way. But with science, <span style="color:#E74C3C; font-weight:bold;">nature decides what's true</span>,and sometimes it does so in a harsh way.
<span style="color:#2E86C1; font-weight:bold;">Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</span> once said:

"<span style="color:#F39C12; font-weight:bold;">Science is a beautiful gift to humanity; we should not distort it.</span>"

Maybe what seems like science's "selfishness" is actually a <span style="color:#27AE60; font-weight:bold;">strength</span>, not a flaw. It's focused on finding <span style="color:#9B59B6; font-weight:bold;">truth</span>, or at least, on being <span style="color:#3498DB; font-weight:bold;">reliable</span>.

## A Quote I Made Up (Feel Free to Steal) 😄

"<span style="color:#E67E22; font-weight:bold;">Science is like a reliable friend who keeps changing how they give directions, but somehow, they always help you get home, and it's hard to argue with them when they have evidence.</span>"
— <span style="color:#9B59B6; font-style:italic;">Maybe A PhD at 2 AM</span>

## Reflections 💭
I don't have all the answers. What I do have is <span style="color:#E74C3C; font-weight:bold;">curiosity</span> and experiences that taught me to <span style="color:#3498DB; font-weight:bold;">question everything</span>, even the methods that led to my PhD. It's a deep unknown, and I'm fine with that.
The philosophy of science is <span style="color:#8E44AD; font-style:italic;">messy</span>. It sits in that awkward space between "<span style="color:#27AE60;">we know things</span>" and "<span style="color:#E74C3C;">do we really?</span>" Maybe that discomfort is what matters most.

If you want to explore this topic more, the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html) is a great place to spend a few hours, or even days 📚

**Personal Note 🌟**

Writing this made me remember why I first loved research, not for the papers or citations, but for the <span style="color:#F39C12; font-weight:bold;">wonder</span> and <span style="color:#3498DB; font-weight:bold;">curiosity</span> of figuring things out. The questions without easy answers. The 2 AM thoughts that won't go away.
Sometimes having a PhD brain feels like a <span style="color:#E74C3C;">curse</span>. Other times, it's a <span style="color:#27AE60;">gift</span>. Today, it's <span style="color:#9B59B6; font-weight:bold;">both</span>. 🧠✨

Thank you for reading! If any of this connects with your own late-night thoughts, I'd love to hear what you think. I hope you found something to <span style="color:#27AE60;">learn</span> or be <span style="color:#3498DB;">curious</span> about.

If you enjoyed this, please click the <span style="color:#E74C3C;">❤️ heart</span> at the end.
