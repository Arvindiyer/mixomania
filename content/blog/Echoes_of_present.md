*Why linger where the echoes softly sigh?*  
*Where shadows hold the shape of each goodbye.*  
*A fading voice, a scent upon the breeze,*  
*A memory that begs the soul to freeze.*  

*Why drown within a sorrowful lullaby,*  
*A melody of grief beneath the sky?*  
*Though sweet the tune, its chords confine the mind,*  
*To chapters closed, to what was left behind.*  

*The ocean of what's gone can pull you deep,*  
*Enticing you with dreams that never sleep.*  
*Its tides are warm with yesterdays once dear,*  
*Yet drag you far from everything that's near.*  

*But sunlight on the present makes you leapâ€”*  
*It dances on the moments we can keep.*  
*It warms the now, it paints today in gold,*  
*A gift that even time cannot withhold.*  

*So rise above the waves of might-have-been,*  
*Let not regret become the place youâ€™ve been.*  
*The past may whisper, but it cannot bind,*  
*So breathe the air that fills your lungs with light,*  

*So linger not where shadows softly sigh,*  
*But dance within the light that draws you nigh.*  
*For every moment holds a world anew,*  
*And in the present, life begins to bloom.*    

## Reflections

**It's in the present moment that joy is made, and futures are born.**

This poem explores our deep attachment to the past and how it quietly shapes the present. Memories can be warm, but they can also stall us. They offer comfort, yes, but often at the cost of clarity. Staying too long in their embrace may stop us from living fully.

## Personal Note

I often find myself drifting into memoryâ€”sometimes out of longing, sometimes habit. Writing this poem helped remind me that while the past shaped me, it doesnâ€™t have to anchor me. Life waits in the now, not in the might-have-beens. It is cycle for me and sometimes I need to remind myself of this.
