We’ve all felt it—**that silent pressure** building inside when you’re trying to hold everything together. It’s like being a **steam cooker**, with emotions and expectations trapped beneath a lid, waiting to burst. 😩💨

In friendships, especially, there's often a gap between what we *say* and what we *feel*. It’s easy to smile, laugh, and act like everything’s fine on the surface, but sometimes, we’re carrying an unseen weight. The emotional **turmoil** is there, but it's hidden behind carefully crafted facades. 🤐

I wrote this poem to explore the **silent struggle** we often face when expectations in friendship aren’t met, when we can’t communicate what we truly need, and when we’re left overthinking what’s unspoken.

## Boiling Point

There’s turmoil rising in my chest,  
A steam cooker that never gets to rest.  

My thoughts race wild, my words stay still,  
Each silence shaped by quiet will.  

We laugh, we talk, but never deep,  
The things that matter never leap.  

Each brick is doubt, each stone is fear,  
You’re close in flesh, but not in here.  

Expectation poisons slowly,  
Friendship strains but doesn’t show.  

Expectation poisons deep,  
Friendship cracks, but never weeps.  

Overthinking fills the space,  
I speak, but feel you can’t keep pace.  

Happiness knocks, then slips through,  
A fleeting thing, like morning dew.  

The cooker hums with steady heat,  
Till silence breaks—or hearts retreat.  

I cry inside—my face stays still,  
It’s easier to mask than to spill.  

You see the front, not what’s raw,  
The wall I built without a flaw.

## Reflections

This poem is a mirror to those **unsaid** feelings we carry in friendships. It’s about the expectations we place on others without speaking them out loud and the **pressure** of trying to keep everything *together* even when it feels like it’s falling apart. 👥💭

In friendship (and any relationship), it’s crucial to break free from the **invisible walls** we construct. Honest conversations, even if difficult, help us understand one another better. 💬 We all carry burdens, but sharing them is the first step to easing the weight.  

The steam cooker’s lid doesn’t need to stay shut forever. There’s **relief** in letting the pressure out, in expressing the emotions we often hide. When we do, we not only lighten our own load but also create space for deeper, more meaningful connections. 🌱

A true relationship is not about hiding behind masks or carrying silent burdens. It’s about **speaking** honestly, **growing** together, and embracing vulnerability. 

If this resonated with you, share this post with a friend who might need to hear it.  

Sometimes, all it takes is the right conversation to break through the silence and grow together. 🗣️💬
